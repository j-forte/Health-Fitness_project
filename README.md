Scope:
FitLife360 is a synthetic dataset that simulates real-world health and fitness tracking data from 3,000 participants over a one-year period. The dataset captures daily activities, vital health metrics, and lifestyle factors, making it valuable for health analytics and predictive modeling.

# Research Objective
With this data what can we tell about the health status of the participants. What ranges and levels of fitness are the participants. are there any meaning full correlations in the data set. Can we see any trending health improvement from the participants. is blood pressure an overall identifier for a healthy active participant.
