# Health-Fitness_project
Scope:
FitLife360 is a synthetic dataset that simulates real-world health and fitness tracking data from 3,000 participants over a one-year period. The dataset captures daily activities, vital health metrics, and lifestyle factors, making it valuable for health analytics and predictive modeling.

# Research Objective
Can a combination of exercise intensity, daily activity (steps), sleep, and stress level serve as a reliable predictor of a participant's overall fitness and health outcomes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, or BMI?
